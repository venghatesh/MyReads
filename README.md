# MyReads: A Book Lending App

> Venghatesh Srinivasan

## About

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Application functionality
1. Searching the books using Book API and add it to the book shelf. To go to the Search page , the main page has got a + Button displayed on the right hand side bottom of the page.
2. There are three book shelves. The first shelf is the
  a) Currently Reading
  b) Want to Read
  c) Read
  We can move the books between these shelves. This is done by using setState API which would trigger state change . This state change could be captured and based on that , the books could be moved to the relevant shelves.
